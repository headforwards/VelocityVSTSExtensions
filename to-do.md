# Things still to do

1. Marketplace icons and information are incorrect or out of date
2. Allow chart colours to be configured
3. Can the x axis labels be dropped when there are loads of them - currently they overlap too much
4. Change default options to use standard state and columns? 
5. Make headforwards an approved publisher
6. Update GitHub readme
